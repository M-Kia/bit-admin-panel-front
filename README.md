This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with admin panel UI from [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1161030350747233731). The purpose of this project is to learn basic of Next 13 App directory and use it in a real project. Also I use [material UI](https://mui.com/) in this project to learn that, too.

## Todo List

- [x] Use Next.js App Directory features
- [x] Use Material UI components
- [ ] Use React-Hook-Form

First, you should clone the back-end of this project ([express.js](https://github.com/M-Kia/bit-panel-back-express.git)). Then, clone this project:

git clone "https://github.com/M-Kia/bit-panel-front.git"
```

Then, after going to the created directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Now you can run the development server for this project with `npm run dev`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
